#BENFORD'S LAW 
	Using numpy arrays of random floating numbers
	
	Need to figure out how to vary the array size 
	and the way each element gets initialized so
	that it can be adapted across multiple applications
	(when I had the gscale set to a number higher 
	than 9999 the compiler threw an error)
