#=========================================================Benford's Law
#Benford's law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law,
#the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law,
#is an observation about the frequency distribution of
#leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data.
#=========================================================Formula
#Scientifically, Benford's Law is based on base-10 logarithms
#that show the probability that the leading digit of a number
#will be n can be calculated as:
#                                        log10(1+1/n)
#import numpy n such
import numpy as np

#(side thought: 'Angstroms are a measure of size)
